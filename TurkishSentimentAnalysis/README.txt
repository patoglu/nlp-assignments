

//FOR FAST RESULTS SIMPLY RUN THE main.py







 
//FOR COMPLETE FLOW OF THE PROJECT:






1-) First run the file_operations.py script in order to organize files / do preprocessing
2-) From our training data set a.k.a file2.csv delete two words:
	one is etmezzzzzzzzzzzz....
	other is filminnnnnnnnnnnnn... 
	because word2vec limits the word limit, I didn't want to change the source code.
3-)for training our model run the main.py.

accuracy is 0.66
